# Privacy Policy — LaunchTrack App

Last updated: Dec, 1, 2025

Thank you for using LaunchTrack.
Your privacy is important. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles your data.

LaunchTrack is operated by Ernesto Cisnero (“we”, “us”, or “our”).

### 1. Information We Collect

LaunchTrack is designed to provide information about upcoming space launches.
The app is intentionally minimal and does not collect or store personal data from users.

Specifically, we **do not** collect:

Names

Email addresses

Phone numbers

Location data

Photos, videos, or media

Device identifiers

Analytics or tracking information

The only data processed is limited to what is needed to fetch launch information from public APIs.

### 2. Data from External APIs

LaunchTrack retrieves upcoming launch data from a third-party public API.
This retrieval is read-only and does not involve any personal information.

We do not control or manage the data provided by the external API.
No personally identifiable information (PII) is received, stored, or transmitted.

### 3. How We Use Information

Because LaunchTrack does not collect personal data, we do not use personal information for any purpose.

The only actions performed by the app are:

Requesting launch data from a public API

Displaying launch schedules and countdowns

No data is used for marketing, tracking, analytics, or user profiling.

LaunchTrack does not collect any personal information from users. All ads served in the app are non-personalized.

### 4. Third-Party Services

LaunchTrack does not use:

Advertising services

Analytics SDKs

Tracking libraries

Cookies

Social media integrations

The external launch API may have its own policies. You can review them on their website. ([TheSpaceDevs](https://thespacedevs.com/))

### 5. Children’s Privacy

LaunchTrack does not collect any personal information and is safe for users of all ages.
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.

### 6. Security

Since LaunchTrack does not store or transmit personal data, no personal data can be exposed or compromised.

Network requests to external APIs use secure HTTPS whenever available.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy if features change.
Any updates will be posted on this same page with a new “Last updated” date.
